                                    <p><span class="firstLetterFirstPara">T</span>here are a ton of typos to clean up and for whatever reason editing a file directly in Github isn't propagating those changes to the actual page. Seems like I'm having the same issue as the publisher of my study guide, although I suspect they have a much higher budget than I. I could probably find a way to get the page to accept documents like .doc or .odt files, but the big problem of the day from the last post seems to be a perpetual one. Good news is I found a cool new browser - Vivaldi, plus cryptocurrency seems to be really taking off across multiple industries. I've been swimming in a project related to crypto which is pretty ambitious, but I hope it will shed some light... somewhere in the vast wilderness that is crypto. Crypto is a liability minefield in many ways, but the technology has the potential to change the world. Imagine being able to create a general ledger for all of a company's transactions completely error free. Not to mention it's a system specifically designed using some of the best available cryptography protocols to ensure the data is tamper free. The ledger is automatically amended for every transaction, it's error free and very nearly tamper-proof.</p>

                                    <p><span class="firstLetterFirstPara">I</span>t's a dangerous field to be regardless of potential liabilities,partly because it promises to disrupt so many industries. There are elements across multiple industries that would like to to pull crypto into the current financial regulatory schemes in existence. The problem there is crypto is like nothing we've seen before. Any attempt to cram crypto into current rules will expand the rules of the current regulatory system to the point authorities will be able to pull the trigger based on a whim and not sound legal, accounting or financial principles. Calls for mark to market treatment of crypto would chill trading, and especially mining. The crypto miners are the backbone of the blockchain and forcing IPOs instead of ICOs would only serve to hobble innovation in the countries applying that force.</p>


                                    <p><span class="firstLetterFirstPara">A</span>fter witnessing Elon Musk, a private citizen, launch his personal car into space it's very difficult to get behind widespread regulation of crypto. Currently the underlying technology is solving many problems regulations sought to solve in a prior age. Many of the rules and regulations relating to finance breakdown at some point when applied to crypto, and the breakdowns occur at different points for different coins or tokens or smart contract. An entirely new regulatory regime would have to be drafted and it would have to span multiple disciplines. Unfortunately, the current system cannot keep up with the technology and regulating it using, in this context, antiquated rules will only serve to disable the industry. This desire to stifle crypto is strong among many of those who depend on the current rules and do not have the wherewithal to adapt. The benefits to everyone if crypto succeeds far outweigh the personal benefits the "poo pooers," for lack of a better term, and I feel it's important more people see that.</p>

It's my understanding most schools have a no refund policy, although none of the, probably too, many schools I've attended has inquired about my employment status. The more I learn about accounting, the more I realize people just want to game numbers and that's another reason why crypto and it's brute accuracy is so important.</p>

Job hunting, and rejection, has been taking its toll on me mentally. It's exhausting speaking with recruiters and managers trying to sell them my skills, especially when selling is not one of my strengths. I also found out I was 'marked ineligible for rehire' by a former employer. No reason given, and no reason I can think of. My performance was good, I only took one day off, worked overtime, and even went above and beyond my job duties in some cases. The only reason I can think of is my manager didn't like me, or maybe discrimination? I'm not sure but it's exhausting trying to figure it out, and I'm not entirely sure it would be worth it in the long run.</p>

It's returning correct results for the inputs set up, and although more inputs could be added in order to provide a user more information, I'm okay with leaving the calculator as is. It will give me an opportunity to work on some of the other calculators I have planned. Assuming I can find work and don't end up on the streets. Ugh, that is a chilling thought.</p>

A good chunk of time was spent testing the inputs to see which were returning incorrect results, and a proper changelog would have cut this time significantly.</p>

Good news is I'll live in an area where I can afford a decent house in a nice neighborhood. I also spent some time updating the IRA contribution calculator.

It's getting easier, but I still have a long way to go before I can write something that not only works, but is efficient and well documented. As of right now it looks like some sort of code-nado with functions just scattered randomly and I will go from jquery to javascript seemingly randomly. But it works so far, so I'm pretty happy about that. Otherwise, I'm still working on the AMT article, but my curiousity and fascination with the IRS and Internal Revenue Code has been left behind me, and it's turning into a thankless chore. There is a certain level of satisfaction with solving programming problems, but unraveling the IRS forms and manuals is something I can do, but isn't nearly as rewarding when just 'translating; to plain English rather than computer code.</p>

                                    <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">T</span>oday's big problem is job hunting. This may have been the Big Problem of the Day before, and I'm sure it will be again. One of the downsides of being an attorney is constantly wondering is someone is breaking the law with regards to hiring. I ended up taking Taxation of Corporations and Shareholders instead of employment law, so I don't have solid understanding how discrimination works. Any time I speak with someone who isn't the same sex, race, religion, sexuality, etc. as me I have to wonder if I'm being rejected for one of those reasons. It is so frustrating because the effect ends up being the EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE LAW INTENDS!!! Of course, even if I'm dealing with someone who is a mirror image of my 'statuses' or whatever, there is no reason they aren't acting on someone else's behalf. Whatever, I really hate discrimination and struggle to understand it since it doesn't make any logical sense. Some will say that is because I've never experienced discrimination, but I genuinely can't comprehend what benefit discrimination would even have for a major company. And at the end of the day I don't think I would be the least bit comfortable working for a company that only hires me because I threaten a discrimination suit. To me it trivializes actual discrimination, which I really only expect at the smallest companies where the owner(s) aren't accountable to anyone but themselves. It is not just frustrating, but demoralizing since I was in the military. It raises the question of 'Is this what I fought for? Is this what good men died for?', and the answer is a resounding No in my mind. I genuinely don't believe most Americans are racist/bigotted, but I can see why people who are willing to make accusations of racism/bigotry/etc would want more discrimination since it would personally benefit them. Who knows, but I hope passing some more exams and keeping my tax knowledge current will be enough. Because there is absolutely no goddam reason it shouldn't be.</p>

                                    <p><span class="firstLetterFirstPara">T</span>he nexct article I'm focusing on is about the Alternative Minimum Tax. There are plenty of resources available which try to explain this somewhat complex area of tax law, however they often come up short. Whether this is due to an inability to communicate the issue in a generally understandable way, or whether it's designed to confuse the reader so they pay the company responsible for the article is anyone's guess. At the core, the AMT is just a denial of certain tax breaks to high income individuals. The amount of people affected by the AMT is relatively small, however in the current economy more people may find themselves impacted by the AMT if their investments are doing particularly well. It will take some time to get the article to the point I am confortable posting it, so there may not be many updates in the meantime.</p>

I ended up revisting the calculator and found scenarios where someone was precluded from contributing to an IRA because their MAGI was too high were not being warned of excess contributions. If they are prohibited from contributing, but did anyway, they have to take those out of face penalties. I implemented the fix in one scenario yesterday, and the rest today. </p>

Well, my unemployment benefits are nearly exhaustion and during my period of unemployment I submitted hundreds of resumes and went on close to a dozen interviews, all to no avail. I'm not sure what I'll do when that happens. Maybe there are programs that help homeless find work, although I'm not sure where I would be working or what type of work I would do. For now I'm using a lot of energy trying to avoid wondering what will happen next, and focusing on creating circumstances that will avoid the worst case scenario. It's almost as if I have to sue in order to be picked for a job I am clearly qualified for, but who wants to work for a company that only hires people who 'won't take no for an answer'?</p>

Somewhere along the lines the calculated contribution amounts stopped rounding to the nearest dollar. Now the calculator should show whole numbers. Also I corrected a few typos in the dev blog. I didn't do any work on the site yesterday as I was still recovering from the 400 mile motorcylce ride I took through the desert this weekend. I didn't realize how much that would sap my endurance, so I just did some light studying and played some No Man's Sky. I'm still working on the MFS calculations, but revised my study plan so I can get at least one part of the CPA exam completed in a reasonable time.</p>

                                    <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">T</span>oday's big problem was interviewing for the positions applied for. I have a phone interview today for what I thought was a tax accounting position but turned into a sales pitch. It comes with the territory, and is one of the big motivations for me wanting to learn how to program. When it comes to tax or financial services or products, software allows for uniformity in delivery as well as reducing fraud to none if properly implemented. If fraud does rear it's head, it is often easier to identify and document when part of a software package, so I see it as a great step in keeping the people just a bit more honest when entrusting them with your financial security.</p>

                                    <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">T</span>oday's big problem is how to handle a changed mind. Or more accuratley how the caculator handles a changed mind. If contributions were already made to an IRA, the contributed amounts reduce the controbution limit. As of this writing, the calculator will take an amount entered in field appearing if the user checks Yes when asked about already made IRA contributions. The limit will be reduced appropriately, however if No is later checked, the reduction will remain. I haven't implemented a solution yet as there are two approaches I could take to deal with this. The first is to include logic which will recalculate the limit without prior contributions, or disable all inputs after the calculator is run. There are pros and cons to each, although the preferable solution would be to allow a user to change their answers on the fly and still get an accurate answer. This is a bit of a challenege, partly due to my inexperience but also because it involves tracing the previously entered contribution amounts throughout the program. I spent some time trying to get the contributed amount zeroed out, however it is proving a bit more challenging than expected. I will revisit this next time I work on this project and mull it over in the meantime.</p>

If they did it changes some of the calculations, but if they didn't the calculations are the same as someone filing as single. Adding the caluclations for MFS and lived with spouse was realtively simple thanks to the excess conrtibution check function I mentioned in a previous post. Getting the page to run the single calculations for MFS should be pretty straighforward as well, I just have to rearrange some of the logic. That can wait until tomorrow though because of the Big Problem of the Day</p>

I was turned down for another opportunity today, although I followed up to find out why. Apparently my resume didn't include the specific task the role I applied for needed. Specifically reviewing work, although return preparation inherently includes reviewing other people's accounting. The more I work and study independently the more I feel qualified for nearly any tax related position. Unfortunately, that is a difficult thing to sell, and many employwers are not looking for someone who can learn, improve and deliver the work, they're looking for someone who has already done the exact same work for a different company. Or in some cases a person just to BS's their way in, although they would never admit it.  There are a plenty of reasons for this way of thinking, including liabity issues, but in my experience the focus is on lessening the manager's own burden. Unfortunately, I'm in a pretty remote area so there are not a lot of networking opportunities, so not much can be done aside from continuing to apply, earn more certifications, and keep working on the site. Hopefully, I can start earning before I end up homeless. My education and experience did not prepare me for that and I would prefer if my skillset did not include vagrancy.</p>

                                    <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">T</span>oday's big problem was software licensing. Since I had to replace my HDD, getting Windows on the new drive was probably the second biggest challenge behind getting a proper system partition. Hopefully no one from Microsoft reads this because it might be seen as a way of passively introducing planned obsolence, although it would be a terrible idea. Anyway, the current licensing problem is with MS Office. It's on my old HDD, but for whatever reason I can only use the cloud based Office 365. This raises an impossible amount of privacy issues when dealing with confidential or priviliged information. Even now when I log into Office 365 I can see documents named such as Client Overview, a document containing personal information and kept under crypto lock and key locally. It's inaccessible from Office 365, but retaining and displaying the titles (even after the document is deleted) introduces unnecessary exposure to potential bad actors. You would think there would be an option to disable this, but apparently it requires Office being installed on your computer, and even when using Office on my old HDD it did not correct the issue.</p>

                                    <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">S</span>o to keep this problem from just being another online rant about Microsoft, I've decided to embrace Linux and Open Office. Since my HDD is 4x as big as my old one, I'm going to spend today setting up a Linux partition and see if it would be worth working in Linux. The only other option is Apple and I've never been a huge fan of their wares, or prices.</p>

For whatever reason the function I wrote to show/hide the inputs for the MAGI recapture items just stopped working. I spent close to a half hour trying to figure out why, and eventually just reverted all the work I did back to the current live version. I still have no idea what was changed and spent some time going over the js and html trying to figure out what broke. The function is a simple add/remove class function and works just fine in the current version. I ended up having an interview, of sorts, today which interrupted the work I was doing, so that likely had to do with it. Regardless, the big problem's solution was to a reiteration of how important backups are, and to makes changes focused and incremented. As this project grows, the moving parts are multiplying, so containing changes as much as possible is key.</p>

Since I don't really have weekends, I like to take Wednesday's pretty easy so not much work was done today. Just an minor bug fix on the Resume page. The first page of this site was my resume so it's mostly html with the just the 'Open All' button having any javascript behind it. This bit of code was the first javascrupt I wrote, and was a simple class toggle for the duties description sections.</p>

                                     <p><strong><span class="firstLetterFirstPara">T</span></strong>he calculator is working correctly under certain conditions at this time. It's not 100% yet, some of the options need to be coded, but the number of functions left to be written should be near 0. The rest of the code should be primarily calls to existing functions. Then styling changes, which I am looking forward to. While I do not consider myself an artist, creating a visual style is fun and so is messing around with CSS. I did not get nearly as much done on the calculator today as I would have liked. The big problem of the day was actually one of a few problems, and was picked because it was the biggest of the few which was solved. Some of the unsolved problems are with negative numbers being entered, zeroing out input fields if they are unselected and disabling inputs. I've mentally sketched out a few possible solutions to these, but solving the big problem of the day introduced a change in program flow. This change will make it easier to solve the rest of the issues, so it was worth the time investment.</p>

The buttons on the landing were too close together, and the buttons on the tools page were too far apart and it was too distracting not to correct. They're updated now with some added symmetry. While the change was pretty simple, the small problem of the day showed up while updating. The landing page had the same code as the tools menu, yet was not behaving the same way. This is today's little problem of the day because I spent 10 minutes going through every element to see if I could figure out why the bootsrtap 'text-left' and 'text-right' weren't working. It was an missing end quote on the div class for the bootstrap columns. I should probably read up on troubleshooting techniques. A seperate 'dev-style' blog section is in the works as well. </p>
