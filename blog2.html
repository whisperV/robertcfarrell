Today the IRA calculator numerical inputs were fixed to only allow positive numbers, and when you click "None of the Above" it no longer zeroes out AGI.</p>

                                    <h2>The Big Problem of the Day</h2>

                                    <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">T</span>oday's big problem was ghost bugs. For whatever reason the function I wrote to show/hide the inputs for the MAGI recapture items just stopped working. I spent close to a half hour trying to figure out why, and eventually just reverted all the work I did back to the current live version. I still have no idea what was changed and spent some time going over the js and html trying to figure out what broke. The function is a simple add/remove class function and works just fine in the current version. I ended up having an interview, of sorts, today which interrupted the work I was doing, so that likely had to do with the interruption. Regardless, the big problem's solution was to a reiteration of how important backups are, and to makes changes focused and incremented. As this project grows, the moving parts are multiplying, so containing changes as much as possible is key.</p>

The hard drive with bad sectors was preventing a full clone of the data on it, so I had to set up the new HDD as the main HDD manually. The first attempt was successful, but the hard drive was only showing 500GB out of 2TB available. The only solution I found was reformatting and reinstalling Windows. Which was done and now the PC boots to the new harddrive, shows the correct size and runs so much better. I'm pretty surprised as how much the old HDD was slowing down my system, mostly in the form of lag when opening programs. Almost feels like a new computer.</p>

Since I don't really have weekends, I like to take Wednesday's pretty easy so not much work was done today. Just an minor bug fix on the Resume page. The first page of this site was my resume so it's mostly html with the just the 'Open All' button having any javascript behind it. This bit of code was the first javascrupt I wrote, and was a simple class toggle for the duties description sections.</p>

                                     <p><strong><span class="firstLetterFirstPara">T</span></strong>he calculator is working correctly under certain conditions at this time. It's not 100% yet, some of the options need to be coded, but the number of functions left to be written should be near 0. The rest of the code should be primarily calls to existing functions. Then styling changes, which I am looking forward to. While I do not consider myself an artist, creating a visual style is fun and so is messing around with CSS. I did not get nearly as much done on the calculator today as I would have liked. The big problem of the day was actually one of a few problems, and was picked because it was the biggest of the few which was solved. Some of the unsolved problems are with negative numbers being entered, zeroing out input fields if they are unselected and disabling inputs. I've mentally sketched out a few possible solutions to these, but solving the big problem of the day introduced a change in program flow. This change will make it easier to solve the rest of the issues, so it was worth the time investment.</p>

The buttons on the landing were too close together, and the buttons on the tools page were too far apart and it was too distracting not to correct. They're updated now with some added symmetry. While the change was pretty simple, the small problem of the day showed up while updating. The landing page had the same code as the tools menu, yet was not behaving the same way. This is today's little problem of the day because I spent 10 minutes going through every element to see if I could figure out why the bootsrtap 'text-left' and 'text-right' weren't working. It was an missing end quote on the div class for the bootstrap columns. I should probably read up on troubleshooting techniques. A seperate 'dev-style' blog section is in the works as well. </p>
