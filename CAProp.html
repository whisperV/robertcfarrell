                                  <p><strong><span class="firstLetterFirstPara">M</span></strong>ost people are familiar with IRS 501(c) organizations, often called non-profit, exempt organizations, charitable organizations, not for profit companies, and so on. These are entities which are organized and run for a specific purpose and, because of this, are not required to pay income tax. While a not for profit-company may not pay income tax, there are a number of other taxes which can be levied on exempt organizations. These are areas where exempt organizations often end up overpaying taxes due to poor planning.</p>

                                  <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">A</span>n organization which qualifies for exemption from income tax at the federal level should also examine their tax liability at the local level. For the purposes of this article we will focus on exempt organizations operating in California and property tax. An exempt organization operating in California which owns property is responsible for paying taxes on that property, regardless of their relief from income tax liability. </p>

                                  <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">W</span>hile property taxes in California are notoriously low, thanks to Prop 13, this is still an area an organization should examine to see if it can reduce its tax burden. A properly organized and operated 501(c) exempt organization may be eligible to qualify for a common exemption known as the ‘Welfare Exemption,’ with the actual legal document being an Organizational Certificate of Clearance - Welfare Exemption. This exemption is overseen by both the Board of Equalization (BoE) and the local county assessor, and an exempt organization can apply using forms provided by the BoE. Not every organization is eligible for this exemption, however, and an understanding of the requirements will help determine if this exemption is worth pursuing, or perhaps worth discussing with a professional. </p>

                                  <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">T</span>he first requirement is the organization must not be formed for profit. While there exist non profit organizations which do not qualify for 501(c) status from the IRS, but are recognized at the state level, the vast majority of non profits are 501(c) organizations. Regardless of what level of income tax exemption an entity has been granted, a letter from the IRS or the Franchise Tax Board must accompany an application for the Welfare Exemption. This alone isn’t enough, however, as some entities which qualify for income tax exemptions may not qualify for property tax exemption. Some of the additional hurdles and organization must overcome are related to the organization’s purpose. Acceptable purposes are religious, hospital, scientific or charitable. The definition of what a religious, scientific, charitable or hospital purpose is not immediately clear, and whether your organization's mission is a religious, scientific, charitable, hospital purpose or none of the above will take a bit of analysis. </p>

                                  <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">E</span>xactly what constitutes a religious purpose is not limited to the widely known religions of the world, and depending on how property is being used a religious organization has a few options. For many religious organizations, taking advantage of the Church Exemption will relieve the property tax burden on any property used specifically for worship. For other property, such as homeless shelters, soup kitchens or other property not used solely for worship, a welfare exemption is a viable option. Most widely known religions would qualify, however lesser known religious beliefs may also be eligible. This isn’t to say a group of musicians who purport to follow Henry Rollins as an instrument of god sent to rock the world will qualify as a religious organization, but there is hope as California courts have recognized “A cult involving a gregarious association openly expressing the belief” as meeting the definition of religious purposes. If your organization is connected to, funded by, or part of a widely accepted religion, it will likely meet the religious purpose test, however if your organization falls into the same category as the musicians discussed earlier, it is best to speak with a professional before requesting a welfare exemption. </p>

                                  <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">H</span>ospitals are exempt from property taxes under the welfare exemption as well, and the California Supreme Court has defined a hospital as “A hospital is primarily a service organization. It serves three groups: the patients, its doctors, and the public … These facilities also stand ready to serve the community in times of epidemic or disaster.” Any organization operating a traditional hospital should not be paying property tax. Also eligible to qualify as an organization with a hospital purpose are organizations which support a traditional hospital. One caveat is the supporting organization must be organized solely to support the hospital. One example would be a waste disposal exempt organization which gathers and disposed of hospital waste. While this organization could be seen as having an environmental purpose, if it was organized solely to support the hospital it would qualify for the Welfare Exemption.</p>

                                  <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">F</span>or organizations exclusively dedicated to scientific purposes, the organization must be chartered by the United States Congress, and the activities of the organization must benefit the community at large. Meeting those requirements alone isn’t enough, however, as property tax exemptions can only be granted if authorized by the California Constitution, which makes no mention of scientific purposes. This means any property used for scientific purposes must also be used for religious, charitable or hospital purposes. Organizations operating specifically for scientific purposes must also meet the specific requirements for religious, charitable or hospital proposes discussed elsewhere in this article. </p>

                                  <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">T</span>he term ‘charitable proposes’ encompasses a broad range of activities. The Board of Equalization generally accepts any activity which benefits the community as a whole or an unspecified portion of the community. One caveat however is the property operate exclusively for charitable purposes. For example, a scientific organization described above, which offers free vaccinations for a community without restrictions on who can receive these vaccinations, would likely qualify for relief if the property being used is dedicated exclusively for this purpose or related beneficial services for the community. Activities which benefits the organization, at the expense of the community, could cause an existing exemption to be revoked or a sought after exemption to be denied. For example, a vaccination clinic collecting and selling patient information to a for profit pharmaceutical company. The privacy of the community is being traded to a for profit company, even if the revenue is reinvested in the nonprofit, and the clinic is no longer purely benefiting the community. </p>

                                  <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">T</span>he Board of Equalization’s interpretation of what activities actually benefit the community as a whole can be a bit of a mystery at first, but the California courts have helped clarify this requirement. The courts have found the term charitable is to be interpreted broadly and includes any organization which lessens the burden of the government while providing a benefit to society as a whole. For example, an organization operating to preserve natural environments and recreational opportunities was found to conducting charitable activities even though these activities did not relieve distress or poverty. </p>

                                  <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">I</span>n addition to requiring an organization's purpose align with the intent of the Welfare Exemption from property tax, the formative documents of the organization must include two items. A document showing the property is irrevocably dedicated to the organization's purpose as well as a dissolution clause which ensures the organization's assets will be contributed to another organization whose purpose mirrors the dissolving entity. For example, a zoo, which was granted a Welfare Exemption, had to have provided to the BoE a legally binding document which show what happens to the zoo's assets upon dissolution. In this example, a common solution would be to name one or more not for profit zoos which would absorb the dissolving zoo's assets.</p>

                                  <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">T</span>he final requirement is an organization's activities may not directly or indirectly provide a gain to any of the members. The president of a not for profit organization which takes disadvantaged youth on trips to national parks for example, cannot contract with his or her own transportation company to provide transportation in exchange for a profit. This requirement is applicable to even an organization income tax exempt status, however, and most not for profits are well aware of the dangers of private benefit to the members.</p>

                                  <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">T</span>here are many different tax breaks available, and this article only briefly touched on one of them. The takeaway from this article is this, if you are operating a 501c organization in California, and paying property taxes, you may benefit from consulting a professional. If your exempt organization can reduce its tax burden, those funds can be reallocated to further the organization’s mission, rather than fending off the tax collector.</p>
