            <div class="centerText">Robert is a quick learner and hard worker with a variety of experience and skillsets. With a foundation in finance, accounting and tax law, the heavy reliance on software to apply and execute 
                the rules convinced Robert to begin a journey into application development. Using software to perform tasks is the best way to increase accuracy and efficiency and bring the skills acquired over 
                years of education and experience to more people and at an affordable cost.
