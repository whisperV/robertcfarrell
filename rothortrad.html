                                  <p><strong><span class="firstLetterFirstPara">R</span></strong>educing a tax bill by saving for retirement is attractive proposal to many taxpayers, and an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) offers this possibility. The rabbit hole of IRAs can be seemingly endless, but a common question is whether a Roth or Traditional IRA is a better investment. Since the deadline for making an IRA contribution is the same as for filing an individual tax return<sup>i</sup>, this is a common question during tax filing season. IRA options are limited to Roth or Traditional for self-employed individuals, however this article will focus on wage earning employees.</p>
                                   
                                   <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">B</span>oth Roth and traditional IRAs offer tax deferment on any earnings, or growth, on the investments, but the timing of this tax savings is a key difference. Before retiring, a Roth IRA will allow taxes to be paid on the income used to make the initial investment, while a traditional IRA will allow the invested amount to be deducted from taxable income in the year invested. After retirement, the tax treatment of the distributions are different as well, with a Roth IRA’s distributions being nontaxable, while a traditional IRA distribution will be considered taxable income. Roth IRAs also have a few other characteristics the traditional IRA lacks, which are helpful in determining which type of IRA to make a contribution. </p>

Married couples filing jointly (MFJ) have a limit of $11,000, even if only one spouse works, but household income must be above $11,000. Taxpayers over 50 years of age are able to contribute a $1000 in additional to the general limit, or $6,500 annually.</p>

                                 <h2>Other Considerations</h2>

                                  <p><strong><span class="firstLetterFirstPara">I</span></strong>f a taxpayer qualifies to make a contribution to a Roth IRA, there are two important attributes of Roth IRAs to consider. The absence of required minimum distributions and the ability to maintain an employer provided ‘designated Roth account.’</p> 

                                  <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">R</span>equired minimum distributions kick in once a taxpayer with a traditional IRA reaches 70 ½ years old. As the name implies, these distributions are required and a taxpayer is subject to penalties if these distributions are not made. In addition required distributions, no more contributions can be made. The same taxpayer with a Roth can make contributions ad mortem, and isn’t required to make any distributions. This makes a Roth IRA worth considering for estate planning purposes as well as retirement planning. Another nice feature of the Roth IRA is the ability to maintain an employer provided Roth-like account such as a Roth 401k, or 403b. The IRS considers these accounts designated Roth accounts, however the contributions to these accounts do not impact your ability to contribute to a personal Roth IRA account. This allows for more overall contributions to a tax favored retirement account.</p>

                                  <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">T</span>raditional IRAs allow for the maximum contribution even when covered by an employee sponsored plan, however the amount that can be deducted may be reduced. A taxpayer with a traditional IRA who also participates in an employer sponsored retirement plan, will have to do some additional calculations to determine how much of their contribution can be deducted.</p>

                                  <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">I</span>n order to figure out the tax treatment for a traditional IRA contribution is to determine MAGI again, which is calculated slightly different than the MAGI used to determine Roth eligibility. The same deductions are added back, however there is obviously no need to subtract any income which was the result of an IRA conversion. Once the MAGi for traditional IRA purposes is establishedFiling status and coverage by an employer sponsored retirement plan will determine the MAGI thresholds for calculating the deductible portion of a contribution. Anyone can contribute up to the general limit for a traditional IRA, however there is little benefit in doing so if the contribution is not tax deductible. A non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA doesn’t carry any tax benefits. You still have to pay tax on the earnings with an adjustment for any returns of non-deductible contributions being repaid. For someone who is ineligible for a Roth IRA and is disallowed from deducting any IRA contributions would be in a similar position as someone holding a personal brokerage account, however the distributions from the IRA will be taxed at ordinary rates rather than capital gain rates. For most people, nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA are not worth it, but there could exist a very narrow set of circumstances where maintaining nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA would provide a benefit. Most of these benefits materialize at the state level, with some states offering tax breaks for IRA distributions, and a few have laws which can make an IRA viable for an asset protection vehicle. Another reason to make nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA is when there is a plan to convert it to a Roth IRA at a later time.</p>

                                 <h2>Conversions and Re-characterizations</h2>


                                  <p><strong><span class="firstLetterFirstPara">W</span></strong>hile Roth IRAs have contribution limits, converting from a traditional to a Roth can be done by anyone. Converting from a traditional to a Roth IRA is sometimes referred to as a ‘backdoor’ conversion. In sum, the MAGI limits determine who can make contributions to a Roth IRA, but a conversion isn’t a contribution so those limits do not apply. The tax consequences of this conversion can be pretty significant. This is because the earnings are added to income in the year of conversion. Also, any traditional IRA contribution amounts which were deducted previously have to be added as income as well. This opens up the possibility of having a Roth IRA to nearly any taxpayer willing to foot the tax bill. </p>
                                   
                                  <p class="newPara"><span class="firstLetter">C</span>onverting from a Roth IRA to a traditional IRA is a possibility as well, a ‘re-characterization’ in industry jargon. The flexibility in switching between a Roth or traditional IRA allows their tax characteristics to be used in managing the investments in the IRA. For example, someone converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA will usually have additional income as the result of this conversion. If this conversion is done in Year 1, and in mid-year 2 the investments in the IRA are showing losses. The conversion created income based on a larger amount than it would have if it was done in year 2. This conversion can be recharacterized as a traditional contribution, allowing for the year 1 tax return to be amended to show the deduction for contributions if applicable. Now in year 2, the IRA is considered a traditional IRA which can be converted to a Roth IRA. The additional income added from this transaction, if any, will be less than if the conversion was allowed to stand in Year 1.</p>

                                 <h2>General Conclusion</h2>

                                  <p><strong><span class="firstLetterFirstPara">O</span></strong>f course, the only answer to the questions of which is better, Roth or traditional, is “it depends on the taxpayer’s individual circumstances.” However, the Roth IRA offers much more in the way of planning decisions. The lack of required distributions, tax free distributions, and the ability to get the full spectrum of benefits when participating in an employer provided retirement plan make a Roth IRA the favored choice for many employees. As mentioned, the only way to get the strictly better option for any taxpayer is with a detailed examination of the specific circumstances of that taxpayer.</p>
