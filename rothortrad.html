                                    <p>Whether a Roth or Traditional IRA is a better investment is a common question during tax season. The deadline for a making a contribution is after the end of the tax year, which allows a taxpayer to determine whether a Roth or traditional is the best investment for the future. Self-employed individuals have even more considerations when it comes to the type of IRA they contribute too, but this writing will focus on taxpayers who are employees.
                                    Both Roth and traditional IRAs offer tax deferment on any earnings or growth on the investments, with the timing of this deferment being the key difference. A Roth IRA will allow taxes to be paid on the income used to make the initial investment, while a traditional IRA will allow the invested amount to be deducted from taxable income in the year invested. Tax treatment of the distributions upon retirement are different as well, with a Roth IRA’s distributions being nontaxable, while a traditional IRA distribution will be considered income and taxable as such. The other major difference is the minimum required distributions required on traditional IRAs, which Roth IRAs do not have.

                                  <h2> Limitations and Eligibility</h2> 
                                  
                                   <p>The general limit for any IRA account contributions is $5,500 per taxpayer, meaning up to $11,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly. Taxpayers over 50 years of age are able to contribute up to $5,500 plus an additional $1,000.  These contributions are subject to a number of tax rules which could affect how they are handled on a tax return. There are eligibility requirements to make contributions to Roth accounts, and even if eligible, there are phase out and cut off amounts tied to a taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). Traditional IRA contributions, up to the general limit, can be made by anyone regardless of their income, however how, and if, those contributions are deducted from income may be altered by different regulations. 
                                   Determining the tax consequences of contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA starts with determining eligibility for a Roth account.  If you make contributions to a Roth IRA without meeting the eligibility requirements, you could end up with a penalty for making excess contributions. In order to qualify for a Roth IRA, you can have any filing status, have earned income, and your modified adjusted gross income is below the cutoff point.  
                                   For 2017, your modified adjusted gross income for Roth IRA purposes is determined by taking your adjusted gross income (AGI) and adding back any deductions for: a traditional IRA contribution, student loan interest paid, tuition and fees paid, domestic production activities, or foreign housing. Add back any income which was excluded because it was: foreign earned income or housing, qualified savings bond interest or employer-provided adoption benefits. Lastly, you subtract any income which was the result of an IRA conversion, which will be discussed below. For example, your AGI is $100,000.00, but you took $5,000.00 deduction for student loan interest paid and did not include $10,000.00 of interest from some Series EE bonds, your MAGI for Roth IRA purposes is $115,000.00. 
                                   Once you have your MAGI, you compare to the limits published by the IRS. Different taxpayers will have different limits depending on their filing status. Taxpayers who are married filing separate (MFS), but still lived with their spouse any time during the year are treated different than those who did not live with the spouse at all during the year. Those who did live their spouse anytime during the year and have a MAGI of $10,000.00 or more cannot contribute to a Roth at all. Even with a MAGI under $10,000, eligible contributions are subject to reduction. If someone filing as MFS but lived apart from their spouse for the year, they are treated as filing Single (S).
                                   The MAGI limitations for Married filing joint or qualified widow is under $186,000 for the full amount, no contribution if your MAGI is above $196,000 .00and any amounts between are subject to reduction. Everyone else has a MAGI bracket of $118,000.00 to $133,000.00. <a href="http://www.robertcfarrell.com/iracalc.html">You can click here for a Roth contribution limit calculator></a></p>

                                 <h2>Other Considerations</h2>

                                  <p>If a taxpayer qualifies to make a contribution to a Roth IRA, there are two other attributes of Roth IRAs to consider. These are the absence of required minimum distributions and the ability to maintain an employer provided ‘designated Roth account.’
                                  Once a taxpayer with a traditional IRA reaches 70 and one half years old, they are required to start taking distributions, and can no longer make contributions. The same taxpayer with a Roth can make contributions ad mortem, and isn’t required to make any distributions. This makes a Roth IRA worth considering for estate planning purposes as well as retirement planning. Another quirk of the Roth IRA is the ability to maintain an employer provided Roth-like account such as a Roth 401k, or 403b. The IRS considers these accounts designated Roth accounts, however the contributions to these accounts do not impact your ability to contribute to a personal Roth IRA account. This allows for more overall contributions to a tax favored retirement account. 
                                  Traditional IRAs allow for the maximum contribution even when covered by an employee sponsored plan, however the amount that can be deducted may be reduced. A taxpayer with a traditional IRA who also participates in an employer sponsored retirement plan, will have to do some additional calculations to determine how much of their contribution can be deducted. The first is determining your MAGI, which is slightly different than the MAGI used to determine Roth eligibility. The same deductions are added back, however there is no need to subtract any income which was the result of an IRA conversion. Filing status and coverage by an employer sponsored retirement plan will determine the MAGI thresholds for calculating the deductible portion of a contribution. Anyone can contribute up to the general limit for a traditional IRA, however there is little benefit in doing so if the contribution is not tax deductible. A non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA doesn’t carry any tax benefits. You still have to pay tax on the earnings with an adjustment for any returns of non-deductible contributions being repaid. For someone who is ineligible for a Roth IRA and is disallowed from deducting any IRA contributions would be in a similar position as someone holding a personal brokerage account, however the distributions from the IRA will be taxed at ordinary rates rather than capital gain rates. For most people, nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA are not worth it, but there could exist a very narrow set of circumstances where maintaining nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA would provide a benefit. Most of these benefits materialize at the state level, with some states offering tax breaks for IRA distributions, and a few have laws which can make an IRA viable for an asset protection vehicle. Another reason to make nondeductible contributions to a traditional IRA is when there is a plan to convert it to a Roth IRA at a later time.</p>

                                 <h2>Conversions and Re-characterizations</h2>


                                   <p>While Roth IRAs have contribution limits, converting from a traditional to a Roth can be done by anyone. Converting from a traditional to a Roth IRA is sometimes referred to as a ‘backdoor’ conversion. In sum, the MAGI limits determine who can make contributions to a Roth IRA, but a conversion isn’t a contribution so those limits do not apply. The tax consequences of this conversion can be pretty significant. This is because the earnings are added to income in the year of conversion. Also, any traditional IRA contribution amounts which were deducted previously have to be added as income as well. This opens up the possibility of having a Roth IRA to nearly any taxpayer willing to foot the tax bill.  
                                   Converting from a Roth IRA to a traditional IRA is a possibility as well, a ‘re-characterization’ in industry jargon. The flexibility in switching between a Roth or traditional IRA allows their tax characteristics to be used in managing the investments in the IRA. For example, someone converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA will usually have additional income as the result of this conversion. If this conversion is done in Year 1, and in mid-year 2 the investments in the IRA are showing losses. The conversion created income based on a larger amount than it would have if it was done in year 2. This conversion can be recharacterized as a traditional contribution, allowing for the year 1 tax return to be amended to show the deduction for contributions if applicable. Now in year 2, the IRA is considered a traditional IRA which can be converted to a Roth IRA. The additional income added from this transaction, if any, will be less than if the conversion was allowed to stand in Year 1.</p>

                                 <h2>General Conclusion</h2>

                                  <p>Of course, the only answer to the questions of which is better, Roth or traditional, is “it depends on the taxpayer’s individual circumstances.” However, the Roth IRA offers much more in the way of planning decisions. The lack of required distributions, tax free distributions, and the ability to get the full spectrum of benefits when participating in an employer provided retirement plan make a Roth IRA the favored choice for many employees. As mentioned, the only way to get the strictly better option for any taxpayer is with a detailed examination of the specific circumstances of that taxpayer.</p>
